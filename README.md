# emacs-settings
My personal emacs-settings and documentations

## .emacs
Do not write much in .emacs. Just load emacs-settings.el from .emacs.

## Tab
* Do not use tab. Indent with space.
* Use different tab-width for different modes.

## Backup
* Collect backups in one place (.emacs.d/emacs-backups).

## Keybindings.
* `C-h` as backspace - move help command to `C-?`.
* `C-c >` and `C-c <` for region shifting. Shift size depends on tab-width.
* Use `<RET>` as newline, use `C-j` as indent newline.
* Use vim-like keys for navigating windows (h-j-j-l with `C-c`).
* Place non-package-depending keybindings at before package manager.

## Package management
Manage package with package manager and melpa archive. Minimize custom packages.
